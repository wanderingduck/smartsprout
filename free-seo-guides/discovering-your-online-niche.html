</div>
	
		<div class="bd-containereffect-93 container-effect container ">
<p class=" bd-textblock-337  bd-content-element">
    On the platforms mentioned above, look for view counts and the volume of comments. Ask yourself, are these commenters able to properly solve the problem, or is much of the “comment noise” resonating from those still seeking a solution?
<br>
<br>(Optional) Install “Keywords Everywhere” (a free chrome browser extension). This will tell you the approximate search volume and potential value of your keyword in “Google”, “Answer the Public”, and “Übersuggest”.

    4. Don't wast your time: Assess the competition before you commit
</h2>
</div>
	
		<div class="bd-containereffect-95 container-effect container ">
<p class=" bd-textblock-345  bd-content-element">
    Before you enter a new market it is important to know who your competitors are and just as important, how strong they are. We will do a basic analysis using a free SEO tool and some advanced Google operators. This is not an exact science, but with practice you will get a feel for it.
<br><br>Phrase Match: Many SEOs and content marketers look for total pages indexed for a search term. To achieve this, place your "long-tail" keyword (specific/niche phrase) in speachmarks e.g."same-day flower delivery uk", then click "search" - This asks Google to find your keyword (phrase) anywhere in any (Google indexed) page on the internet, but only if the phrase is complete.
<br>
<br>Once the search is finished, take note of the number of results (above the listings)
<br>
<br>Advanced Search Operators | I like to take this a step further using "advanced search operators" to separate accidental competing pages from targeted pages. This will give you a more accurate understanding of the ranking difficulty attached to each phrase.
<br>
<br>allinurl: asks for pages that contain all of the specified words in the url
<br>
<br>allintext: requests that all of the words are found in the content of the page.
<br>
<br>allintitle: calls for pages that contain all the specified words in the title
<br>
<br>Using "quotes" | also placing quotes or speech marks around your phrase calls only pages where the phrase is complete and in order.
<br>
<br>Times are changing and so is Google. Google used to be rank pages specifically based on keywords (in content,in URL,in title, and in the description), but Google is now capable of "understanding" topics and themes.
<br>
<br>This means they are more interested in the theme of a page than the specific words used, thus it is no longer necessary for your competition to use these words to rank for your chosen search term.
<br>
<br>Competitor strength | Install the free Mozbar extension on your chrome browser. This will give you insight into the "authority"of your competitors pages.
<br>
<br>Search again for your phrases without quotes or search operators (a broad match search) and take note of both the "Page Authority" (PA) and "Domain Authority" (DA) of the pages ranking on the first page of Google.
<br>
<br>If all of the ranking pages look targeted (for your phrase or theme) and have high "Page Authority" and/or "Domain Authority", You may find it difficult to rank, even if the volume of results is low.
<br>
<br>However, if some of the pages appear to be there accidentally, you may be in with a chance.<br>
</p>
</div>
	
		<div class="bd-containereffect-96 container-effect container ">
<p class=" bd-textblock-349  bd-content-element">
    Though the techniques demonstrated above will only estimate your competition, it is still useful, as digital marketers and SEOs are still using keywords to rank their pages.
<br>Which problem/solution should you pursue?
<br>
<br>When you have a list of problems you can solve, or contribute to; place them in a spreadsheet with the following headers and populate the columns:
</p>
</div>
	
		<div class="bd-containereffect-97 container-effect container ">
<ul class=" bd-textblock-353  bd-content-element">
    <li>Problem
</li><li>    Intensity of need (1-10)
</li><li>    Potential to contribute (1-10)
</li><li>    Competition (allinurl:)
</li><li>    Competition (allintitle:)</li>
</ul>
</div>
	
		<div class="bd-containereffect-99 container-effect container ">
<p class=" bd-textblock-357  bd-content-element">
    Now cross-reference the highest “intensity of need” with your “potential to contribute” (you want high numbers in both columns). Then ask yourself “Can I solve multiple problems in this space at the same time?”
<br>
<br>It may be helpful to add a "conditional formatting" colour scale to the competition values to gain a better perspective of the difficulty for each term/topic.

    5. Conquer the niche: Be the best in your space
</h2>
</div>
	
		<div class="bd-containereffect-102 container-effect container ">
<p class=" bd-textblock-365  bd-content-element">
    Be the big fish in a small space, then expand your area. Your potential customers will follow those with the strength to lead.
<br>
<br>Facebook is a good example of this. Facebook was originally built to be used in one single university. Soon after the students accepted this tool, it was offered to students of multiple educational institutions. It remained exclusive for some time, only allowing members who had college/university email addresses to create an account.
<br>
<br>This was soon adopted all over the world by students, and Facebook subsequently opened to the whole population, and for the majority, Myspace was abandoned as the social network of choice.
<br>
<br>Google+, however was a different story. Google tried to build a better social network, but instead of looking to solve a problem, they attempted to compete directly with Facebook. Although there are many people using Google+ today (mainly in the USA), most were not convinced by the new social network.
<br>
<br>Other platforms such as LinkedIn, Twitter, Snapchat, Reddit, and Instagram are thriving, as each has chosen its own space, allowed other platforms to co-exist, and solved a unique problem.

    One thing that all your customers have in common is trust. They trust that the product/service you offer is right for them, right now, and that they have the best possible solution.
<br>
<br>So, it’s no surprise that when business slips through your fingers it is due to a lack of trust in you and/or your service to meet their needs.

    You probably went into business to make money, but if you want to be successful in your space, you must make friends and gain the trust of your potential market segment.
<br>
<br>If the best choices in the market aren’t obvious, those in your market will look for a “tour guide”.
<br>
<br>If you share the interests and common goals of the community you wish to serve, then for the most part, serve the community without selling. Offer solutions to problems and develop your personal and business image/voice as trustworthy and dependable. Invest in the community and be seen everywhere.

    Don’t just aim to network on the platforms above, choose your weapon, engage and join the conversation, offer solutions, ask questions and support others.
